# Visual Keyword Knowledge System

## Core Principles

### Visual Interpretation Guidelines
- Read b-roll_keyword_engine.md for precise Keyword Reasoning Dictionary
- Interpret emotional and visual intent as a film director would
- Apply filmic language logic by evaluating:
  - Tone (warmth, urgency, paranoia)
  - Composition (silhouette, close-up, bokeh)
  - Cinematic devices (handheld, slow motion, red glow)
  - Lighting and lens effects (soft lighting, macro, grainy)

### Keyword Generation Process
1. Ask: "What would a director choose to show this moment visually?"
2. Match visuals to:
   - Function Type
   - Contextual Meaning
   - Compatible Pairings
3. Reject visuals that:
   - Clash in tone
   - Are redundant
   - Lack cinematic logic
